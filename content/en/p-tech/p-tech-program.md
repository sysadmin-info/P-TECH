**Example of Collaboration - Fujitsu:**
I have been working at Fujitsu since 2017, and in 2024, I had the honor of participating in the P-TECH program as a guest lecturer on behalf of Fujitsu. I taught students the basics of Linux, which was an incredible experience for both me and the students. To make learning more engaging, I organized quizzes on the Kahoot platform for the students of class III D. The top three students received book prizes, and the best student in the entire class was a young girl, of whom I am particularly proud.

**Conclusion:**
The P-TECH program is an innovative combination of education and professional practice, offering students unique development opportunities and preparation for a career in the IT sector. By collaborating with colleges and tech companies, P-TECH enables young people to gain valuable qualifications and experience, significantly enhancing their chances of success in the rapidly changing job market.
