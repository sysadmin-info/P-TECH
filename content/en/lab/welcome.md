In class, we use virtual machines built from an AWS template. Why AWS and not Virtual Box virtual machines? For several reasons. First of all, the price (free 750 hours of machines under the so-called "free tier" and thereafter the unit price per t2.nano machine is $0.0051 per hour per virtual machine. Easier to expose content to the world after installing a web server (Apache2/Nginx). Although in practice, having a VPS, this is done differently and will be covered in the class. There are at least several ways to build sites and applications, and I won't have time to show them all. Speed, simplicity. The disadvantages of AWS? The inability to easily put up your own DHCP or DNS, because AWS performs these services automatically and provides them as a ready-made solution. It can be solved, while it is complicated. Hence, in addition, I am going to look around for a solution to configure the DNS server and DHCP as it is done according to good practices. For each class, I will prepare a solution in such a way as to make it possible to do the exercises, or at least present them according to the rules. Please keep in mind that there is more than one solution, and it is up to you which one you choose. I encourage you to learn and practice on your own by repeating the exercises, commands and understanding what you are doing. Have fun learning!
