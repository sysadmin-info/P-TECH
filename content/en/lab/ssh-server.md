#### OpenSSH : KeyBoard-Intereractive Auth

OpenSSH is already installed by default, so it's not necessarry to install new packages. You can login with KeyBoard-Intereractive Authentication by default, but change some settings for security like follows.

#### Install firewalld

{{< tabs SLES Debian RedHat >}}
  {{< tab >}}
  ### SLES
  To install firewalld type:
  ```
  # refresh repositories
  sudo zypper ref
  # install firewalld
  sudo zypper -n in firewalld
  # enable firewalld on boot
  sudo systemctl enable firewalld
  # start the firewalld
  sudo systemctl start firewalld
  ```
  {{< /tab >}}
  {{< tab >}}
  ### Debian
  To install firewalld type:
  ```
  # refresh repositories
  sudo apt update
  # install firewalld
  sudo apt -y install firewalld
  # enable firewalld on boot
  sudo systemctl enable firewalld
  # start the firewalld
  sudo systemctl start firewalld
  ```
  {{< /tab >}}
  {{< tab >}}
  ### Red Hat
  To install firewalld type:
  ```
  sudo yum install firewalld -y
  or
  sudo dnf install firewalld -y
  # enable firewalld on boot
  sudo systemctl enable firewalld
  # start the firewalld
  sudo systemctl start firewalld
  ```
  {{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

By default the firewalld after installation has SSH service implemented as allowed. If not, you can always allow SSH service.

```
linux:~ # firewall-cmd --add-service=ssh --permanent
success
linux:~ # firewall-cmd --reload
success
```

#### Configure SSH Client
Connect to SSH server with a common user.

```
# ssh [login_user@hostname_or_IP_address]
adrian@client:~> ssh adrian@example.com
The authenticity of host 'example.com (10.0.0.50)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:h0QhlXgCZ860UjM8sAjY6Wmrr2EqSIY5UADBi0wAFV4.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'example.com,10.0.0.50' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
Password:          # login user's password
adrian@example.com:~>    # just logined
```

#### SSH Key-Pair Authentication

Configure SSH server to login with Key-Pair Authentication. Create a private key for client and a public key for server to do it.

Create Key-Pair for each user, so login with a common user on SSH Server Host and work like follows.

```
# create key-pair on a client
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/adrian/.ssh/id_rsa): /home/adrian/.ssh/p-tech
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/adrian/.ssh/p-tech
Your public key has been saved in /home/adrian/.ssh/p-tech.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:IPtApVZ/8o6mCY3lKSvcfEtkD6wzHJ0LzKeHFm3qbxs adrian@G02PLXN05963
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 4096]----+
|      o          |
|     + .         |
|    = . o .      |
|   = * o +       |
|    O % S .      |
|   . ^ = o       |
| . o& E + .      |
|  oooOo=         |
|   .o+*o         |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

To generate a passphrase you can use the following command in a separate CLI window
hexdump -vn16 -e'4/4 "%08X" 1 "\n"' /dev/urandom

List the key-pair

```
adrian@linux:~> ll ~/.ssh/p-tech*
-rw------- 1 adrian adrian 3.4K Apr  1 16:44 /home/adrian/.ssh/p-tech
-rw-r--r-- 1 adrian adrian  745 Apr  1 16:44 /home/adrian/.ssh/p-tech.pub
```

Copy the public key from the client to the server
```
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/p-tech.pub student@IP-ADDRRESS
```

The public key is saved into the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Provide a password

```
# login with the key to the server
ssh -i ~/.ssh/p-tech student@IP-ADDRRESS
```

Provide a passphrase

#### Automation

Add below entries to .bashrc or .zshrc file located in your /home/user directory. First entry starts ssh agent and a second loads your private key to the agent. If you did set up a passphrase on your key it will ask for it. You can add more than one key. Bear in mind, that each time the Bash or Zsh starts aftyer a reboot or boot process of the operating system, in CLI it will ask you to provide a passphrase. 

```
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
ssh-add ~/.ssh/p-tech
```

#### Secure SSH

Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config

```
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Uncomment these lines and change to [no]

PasswordAuthentication no
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no

# Disable Empty Passwords
# You need to prevent remote logins from accounts with empty passwords for added security. 

PermitEmptyPasswords no

# Limit Users‚Äô SSH Access
# To provide another layer of security, you should limit your SSH logins to only certain users 
# who need remote access. This way, you will minimize the impact of having a user with a weak password.
# Add an ‚ÄòAllowUsers‚Äô line, followed by the list of usernames, and separate them with a space:

AllowUsers student adrian

# Disable Root Logins
# One of the most dangerous security holes you can have in your system 
# is to allow direct logging in to root through SSH. By doing so, 
# any hackers attempting brute force on your root password could 
# hypothetically access your system; and if you think about it, 
# root can do a lot more damage on a machine than a standard user can do.
# To disable logging in through SSH as root, change the line to this:

PermitRootLogin no

# Eventually you can allow root to login through SSH using a pair of keys. 
# Do this only if the server is not in the DMZ (there is no access from the Internet)

PermitRootLogin prohibit-password

# Add Protocol2
# SSH has two protocols that it can use. Protocol 1 is older and is less secure. 
# Protocol 2 is what you should be using to harden your security. 
# If you are looking for your server to become PCI compliant, then you must disable protocol 1.

Protocol 2

# Protocol
#  Specifies the protocol versions sshd(8) supports.  The possible
#  values are '1' and '2'.  Multiple versions must be comma-separated.  
#  The default is '2'.  Protocol 1 suffers from a number 
#  of cryptographic weaknesses and should not be used. 
#  It is only offered to support legacy devices.
#  Example: Protocol 2, 1

# Use Another Port
# One of the main benefits of changing the port and using a non-standard port 
# is to avoid being seen by casual scans. The vast majority of hackers 
# looking for any open SSH servers will look for port 22, since by default, 
# SSH listens for incoming connections on that port. 
# If it‚Äôs harder to scan for your SSH server, then your chances of being attacked are reduced.
# Run SSH on a non standard port above port 1024.

Port 2025

# You can choose any unused port as long as it‚Äôs not used by another service. 
# A lot of people might choose to use 222 or 2222 as their port since 
# it‚Äôs pretty easy to remember, but for that very reason, hackers scanning port 22 
# will likely also be trying ports 222 and 2222. Try and select a port number 
# that is not already used, follow this link for a list of port numbers and their known services.

# If StrictModes is set to yes, then the below permissions are required.
# sudo chmod 700 ~/.ssh
# sudo chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

StrictModes yes

# Configure Idle Timeout Interval

ClientAliveInterval 360
ClientAliveCountMax 1

# The timeout value is calculated by multiplying 
# ClientAliveInterval with ClientAliveCountMax.
# timeout interval = ClientAliveInterval * ClientAliveCountMax
#
# OpenSSH options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax 
# are not used to disconnect inactive sessions. 
# They are in fact preventing the connection from being closed, 
# even on inactive sessions, as long as the client and the network link is alive.
#
# This is an internal mechanism of ssh that send a null packet 
# inside the established tunnel, and wait for an answer from the client.
# In this case, it sends one packet every 360 seconds, and disconnect after 1 answer missed.
#
# While these options are helpful to detect and cleanup disconnected client sessions, 
# they will not kill sessions of clients who are still connected, even if inactive. 
# Unless their client doesn't answer the null packet.
```

To disconnect inactive clients, if you are using bash as shell you could set the TMOUT value in a system-wide default or per-user profile:

```
# TMOUT  If  set to a value greater than zero, 
# TMOUT is treated as the default timeout for the read builtin. 
#
# The select command terminates if input does not arrive after 
# TMOUT seconds when input is coming from a terminal. 
#
# In an interactive shell, the value is interpreted as the number 
# of seconds to wait for a line of input after issuing the primary prompt. 
#
# Bash terminates after waiting for that number of seconds 
# if a complete line of input does not arrive.

# For example, adding the following line to `/etc/.bashrc` 
# will close bash sessions of inactive user after 5 minutes, 
# but read the following warning before enabling this:

`export TMOUT=300`

# Warning: as a daily user of shells,
# I often let some terminal open while multitasking.
# I would personally find this TMOUT mechanism very annoying
# if set to a low value (even the 10 minutes). 
# I would not recommend it unless it's at least
# set to a very high value (at least 1 hour - 3600 seconds).

# My opinion is that OpenSSH options `ClientAliveInterval` and `ClientAliveCountMax` 
# (or `ServerAliveInterval` and `ServerAliveCountMax`, set on the server-side) 
# are enough to get rid of zombies/disconnected clients. 

# When using them you are already guaranteed that an active session 
# on the server does match an open terminal on a connected client. 
#
# It's the user's choice to keep their terminal open, while I understand 
# you want to close disconnected clients.
# I don't see the point of closing sessions from legitimate users.
```

#### Secure Configuration of Ciphers/MACs/Kex available in SSH

```
MACs hmac-sha2-512
Ciphers aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr
KexAlgorithms diffie-hellman-group14-sha256,diffie-hellman-group16-sha512,diffie-hellman-group18-sha512,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256,ecdh-sha2-nistp256,ecdh-sha2-nistp384,ecdh-sha2-nistp521,curve25519-sha256,curve25519-sha256@libssh.org
```

Make sure your ssh client can use these ciphers, run:

```
ssh -Q cipher | sort -u
to see the list
```

I recommend to read this article:
[Secure Configuration of Ciphers/MACs/Kex available in SSH](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/39756/secure-configuration-of-ciphers-macs-kex-available-in-ssh "Secure Configuration of Ciphers/MACs/Kex available in SSH")

Restart SSH service
```
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```
